# Copy this file to .env and update with your Unity installation path

# Windows example:
UNITY_PATH="C:/Program Files/Unity/Hub/Editor/2021.3.16f1/Editor/Unity.exe"

# UNITY_PATH="/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/2021.3.16f1/Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity"

# Linux example:
# UNITY_PATH="/home/username/Unity/Hub/Editor/2021.3.16f1/Editor/Unity"

# 2. Go to Installs tab
# 3. Click the three dots (...) next to your Unity version
# 4. Select "Show in Explorer/Finder"
